	\indent
	My research aims to build general, automatic and end-to-end near-data acceleration 
	by revolutionizing the orchestration between data and computation throughout the
	entire system.

	\indent
	Conventional von Neumann architectures draw a clear boundary between computation and
	data, in which centralized compute units process the data provided by memory units.
	However, two forces dramatically changed the landscape: 1. Emerging modern applications,
	e.g. large language models, graph nerual networks, recommend systems, etc., scale rapidly
	with the data size (e.g. GPT-4 has 170 trillion parameters), putting extremely high
	pressure on the memory system; 2. The widening gap between the compute and memory
	throughput (known as the memory wall), as well as the upscaling in system size together
	make the data movement an increasingly bottleneck. To continue the performance and
	energy efficiency scaling, my research takes the data as a first-class citizen in
	system design and spans across extensive aspects of data/computation orchestration
	including microarchitecture designs, ISA abstractions, compiler optimizations, and
	codesigning data structures.

	\indent
	I am currently a sixth-year PhD candidate at UCLA. My open source work has been accepted by
	multiple top-tier conferences in computer architecture, including ISCA, MICRO, ASPLOS,
	HPCA, and awarded Best Paper Runner-Ups as well as IEEE Micro Top Pick Honorable
	Mentions. I am also a maintainer of gem5, a widely used cycle accurate simulator in
	computer architecture.
