      <description>Many computer architecture students will eventually add some new (useless) instructions to a ISA, and there are many great tutorial on how to do this. This is yet another notes on my struggling to extend RISC-V with a new matrix multiply instruction. The overall goal is to add a new functional unit in a general purpose processor to do a 4x4 matrix multiply accumulate with single-precision floating-point.
The Manual has a very detailed explanation on what ISA encoding is reserved for such non-standard extension (see ch.</description>
