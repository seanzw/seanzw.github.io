        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/seanzw/gem5-avx">gem5-avx</a> brings partial
AVX2 and AVX-512 support to gem5. Feel free to use it for your
research at your own risk. There is a short guide on how to add
new instructions at the end of this post. Issues and pull requests
are welcome!</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>During my research this year, I had to implement AVX2 and AVX-512 in
gem5, as I could not find a good online. Eventually I had a partial
implementation which works for the workloads I looked into. Luckily,
the paper gets published in this year&rsquo;s HPCA, and I have already
released the code for that project: <a href="https://github.com/PolyArch/gem-forge-framework/">gem-forge</a>.</p>
<p>There are offical plans to add full AVX support to gem5, but not done
yet. While we are waiting for that, I think it would be helpful to
others if I separate out my implementation and merged to the latest
develop branch. That becomes this project: <a href="https://github.com/seanzw/gem5-avx">gem5-avx</a>!</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Please note that this is only a <strong>partial</strong> support, as IMO it takes
an experienced Ph.D. student at least a year to fully implement
everything. Specfically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not all instructions are impelmented.</strong> I implemented only the
instructions I came across during my research. This amounts to roughly
150 unique instructions (not counting variants of different vector
width, data type, reg/memory operands), including common arithmetic
and data movement instructions, e.g. <code>vaddps</code>, <code>vmovups</code>, <code>vinsertps</code>,
etc.) I will have a short guide on how to implement new instructions
at the end of this post.</li>
<li><strong>Mask and broadcast are not implemented.</strong> AVX-512 introduces mask
registers and a broadcast bit in the prefix. In my research I found
them rarely and just dropped them.</li>
<li><strong>Not throughly tested.</strong> I tested it with a few microbenchmarks
as well as benchmarks for my research, but not every instruction
and every version of it. The repository inclues one test case of
tiled dense matrix-vector multiplication
(see <code>avx-test</code>). However, I think there are certainly bugs in the
code (issues and pull requrests are welcome!).</li>
<li><strong>Instructions to microops.</strong> How instructions are broken into
microops are proprietary. Here I take an ideal approach: most arithmetic
and load/store instructions are break into a single microop. This
may not be very accurate. Please keep this in mind if you use this
for research.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-new-instructions">Adding New Instructions</h2>
<p>There are many examples in <code>src/arch/x86/isa/insts/simd512</code>.
Assuming you are familar with gem5&rsquo;s decoder,
adding new instructions generally involves these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Microops</strong>: If the new instruction can not be implemented using
existing microops, you can define new ones in
<code>src/arch/x86/isa/microops/avxop.isa</code>. However, if there is a scalar
version of the new instructions, it&rsquo;s likely there is an existing scalar
implementation. You can reuse those microops so that you don&rsquo;t have to
define a new one.</li>
<li><strong>Macroops</strong>: Now you can define how the new instruction (macroop)
is broken into microops. Take a look at examples in <code>src/arch/x86/isa/insts/simd512</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Encoding</strong>: Finally you can teach gem5 how to decode the new
instruction. There are two types of prefixes: <code>vex</code> and <code>evex</code>, as
well as 3 types of opcodes: two-byte, three-byte-0F38 and
three-byte-0F3A. So for example, <code>vaddps</code> has two-byte opcode <code>0x58</code>
and comes with both <code>vex</code> and <code>evex</code> prefix. Therefore, you can find
its encoding defined in <code>src/arch/x86/isa/decoder/two_bytes_opcodes_{vex|evex}.isa</code>.</li>
<li><strong>ModRM and Immediate</strong>: The x86 decoder in gem5 uses two tables
to check if the instruction requires ModRM and immediate byte. Make
sure you define that in <code>src/arch/x86/isa/decoder_tables.cc</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Compressed Displacement</strong>: AVX-512 introduces a new addressing
mode called &ldquo;compressed displacement&rdquo; (see &ldquo;Compressed Disp8*N
Encoding&rdquo; in Intel&rsquo;s manual). Make sure you define it correctly in
<code>src/arch/x86/isa/decompress_displacement.cc</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. I hope this post is helpful.</p>
