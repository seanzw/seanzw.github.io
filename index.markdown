#### Projects

##### Pedestrain Tracker
This is a `c++` system using online-boosting classifier and particle filter to track and count pedestrains in a video clip. The video is uncalibrated (without depth information).

Project Repo: [https://github.com/seanzw/PedestrainTracker](https://github.com/seanzw/PedestrainTracker)

##### Yart-cpp
Yet another ray tracer in `c++`. It supports direct light and bidirectional path tracing. For BSDF, it supports perfect specular, perfect refraction and Cook-Torrance.

##### MicroPython on FPGA
[MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) is implementation of Python for embedded system. Under supervision of Peter Y K Cheung at Imperial College London, [Zhixun Tan](https://github.com/phisiart) and I port MicroPython to Altera's DE0-Nano-SoC. We also write a simple Python module to communicate with the FPGA part.

##### ETH Zuerich Computer Graphics
Finished the master course computer graphics in ETH Zuerich. [GitHub Project Page](https://seanzw.github.io/ETHZ-CG-2014)
Ray tracer, normal mapping, B-Spline, surface subdivision, Perlin noise and numerous other basic computer graphics algorithms are implemented with JavaScript and WebGL.
